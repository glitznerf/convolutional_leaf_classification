# Convolutional Leaf Classification
Using (deep) convolutional neural networks to classify a dataset of leaf photos. A 2019 final graduation project in German language during high school.

## Status
Working, but unmaintained since early 2019.

## Info
Supervised by Hans Dietmar JÃ¤ger. \
Studying image recognition using artificial (convolutional) neural networks, using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks for an implementation in Python. \
The dataset is self-collected. Please ask for permission for further usage.

## Details
Please see the final paper "fglitzner_BLL_FINAL3_center.pdf" in GERMAN LANGUAGE for more detailed information and research results.
